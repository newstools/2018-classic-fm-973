Barcelona were held to a draw at Celta Vigo as players were rested before Saturday's Copa del Rey final against Sevilla. Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez started on the bench and Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta were both rested. Ousmane Dembele put Barca ahead before Jonny's tap-in made it 1-1.  Paco Alcacer regained the advantage for the visitors before Sergi Roberto was sent off for a pull on Iago Aspas, who equalised late on in the La Liga match. Paulinho also hit the post for the league leaders on what was a frustrating night for Ernesto Valverde's side.  But Barca extended their unbeaten run to 40 matches and move 12 points ahead of second-placed Atletico Madrid, who have a game in hand.
