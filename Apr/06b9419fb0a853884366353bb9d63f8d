The Senate Wednesday adjourned plenary over the arrest and detention of Senator Dino Melaye by the Nigeria Police. Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Senate also summoned the ‎Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to appear before them in plenary on Thursday by 11am to explain the circumstances surrounding the police operation. The highly emotional lawmakers took turns at plenary to condemn the police for what they described as inhuman treatment of Sen. Melaye by security officials.  President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, lamented that he had not been able to communicate with the IG since 48 hours, describing it as an insult to the legislature. Saraki said that he had sent a delegation to the National Hospital Abuja where Melaye was being treated under the watch of policemen.  The Deputy Majority Leader, Senator Bala Ibn Na’Allah, briefing the lawmakers on the visit‎, said the police did not allow them to see Sen. Dino, adding that the hospital had not been feeding Melaye for fear of being implicated. Our correspondent reports that operatives of Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) had earlier stopped the delegation of the Senate from seeing Senator Dino Melaye who is receiving medical attention at the National Trauma Centre unit of the National Hospital, Abuja.
