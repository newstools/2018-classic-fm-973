Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is to testify before the US House Commerce Committee regarding the firm's use and protection of user data.Â He will testify before the committee on Wednesday, 11 April. Facebook has faced criticism after it emerged it had known for years that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from about 50 million of its users.  Committee chairman Greg Walden and member Frank Pallone, Jr, welcomed the decision by Mr Zuckerberg. "This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online," the pair said.  Facebook is now one of the main ways politicians connect with voters.
