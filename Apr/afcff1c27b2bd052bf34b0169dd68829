The Duchess of Cambridge has given birth to a boy, her third child and second son. The new arrival, who was born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London, is fifth in line to the throne and the Queen's sixth great-grandchild. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth of his son at 11:01 BST, weighing 8lbs 7oz.  A Kensington Palace statement said Catherine and her son are "both doing well". Members of both families had been informed and were "delighted with the news". Kensington Palace said the name of the baby would be announced in due course and a formal notice of the birth would be posted on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. Favourite names at the bookmakers include Arthur, Albert, Frederick, James and Philip.  Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted her "warmest congratulations" to William and Catherine. She said: "I wish them great happiness for the future." Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted: "On behalf of Londoners, I want to send our warmest congratulations to the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their baby boy."  Following a change in the law in 2013, Princess Charlotte keeps her place as fourth in line to the throne. Previously, younger royal males would take precedence over older female siblings.
