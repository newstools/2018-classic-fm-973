Kylian Mbappe scored twice as Paris St-Germain beat Caen to reach the French Cup final for a fourth straight year. PSG winners in each of the past three years went ahead when Mbappe tapped in Edinson Cavani's cross. Ismael Diomande hit a deflected shot home to level things up but Cavani ruled onside by a VAR review again laid on a goal for Mbappe late on. The win was sewn up by Christopher Nkunku as PSG booked a final against third division side Les Herbiers. PSG have already won Ligue 1 and can make it 14 major honours in six seasons if they win on 8 May at the Stade de France.
