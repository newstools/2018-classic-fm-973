In view of the security challenges across the country, Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo says Nigeria will no longer tolerate undocumented cross-border movement of persons, animals. According to the Vice President, Nigeria will follow the regional cooperation model it used in dealing with the threat of Boko Haram to tackle the security threat posed by the escalating violence between farmers and herders.  Prof. Osinbajo who stated this on Thursday at the opening session of the extra-ordinary ministerial meeting of Ministers of Agriculture and Security in ECOWAS Member States, held at the ECOWAS Parliament, in Abuja said Federal Government seeks enforcement of transhumance protocols to avoid escalation of national security challenges.  He noted that the competition for land and water is being complicated by the actions of criminal networks who are taking advantage of the proliferation of illegal weapons as well as our porous borders all across the West African sub-region. He said the sub-regional cooperation that has been put in place helped to cripple the boko  haram menace and called for a similar approach across West Africa, regarding the security situation associated with transhumance migration.
