Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has denied deliberately spitting on the Manchester City badge at Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Television footage shows Herrera spitting on the large badge on the floor at the entrance to the tunnel at the end of the first half.  Writing on social media on Monday, Herrera said: "I will always fight for my club's badge, but I always respect every other club crest too." "Ander has seen footage of the incident and is mortified at any suggestion his actions were deliberate. It was entirely accidental and there was no intent whatsoever."  United were 2-0 down at the time but came back to win 3-2 to delay City's Premier League title celebrations. The Football Association will not be investigating the incident. It is understood City officials feel Herrera deliberately spat at the badge but will not be making a complaint to the FA. The FA will fine City an automatic Â£25,000 after they picked up six yellow cards in the match.  A United spokesperson said the Spaniard did not see the City crest as he was making his way off the pitch. United will not be making a complaint over an allegation that manager Jose Mourinho had a coin thrown at him during second-half injury time. The Old Trafford club have decided not to pursue the matter further.
