The Senate has threatened to summon the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to appear before it at plenary over the failure of the police to apprehend perpetrators of the Benue killing. President of the Senate Bukola Saraki in a series of tweets on his handle @BukolaSaraki said that the upper legislative chamber would not take likely fragrant disregard of its resolutions by officials of government. Saraki said that the Senate had directed its committee on Police and intelligence to summon the police boss but added that if the upper legislative chamber was unsatisfied with the IG at the committee level, then he would be summoned to plenary to give explanations about the Benue killing.  Saraki recalled that two weeks ago, the Senate had mandated the Police IG track down and arrest those responsible for the Benue killing. He however expressed dismay that two weeks after the mandate, nothing seemed to have been done. “Two weeks ago, we gave the IG of Police a deadline to apprehend the perpetrators of the #BenueKillings. Today, we directed the Committees on Police and Intelligence to summon the IG of Police, to explain what actions have been taken since our ultimatum. We must make it very clear to all security agencies that parliamentary ultimatums cannot be taken lightly. If by Tuesday we are not happy with the report that the Senate Committee on Police Affairs is given by the IG, we will summon him to the full plenary”.
