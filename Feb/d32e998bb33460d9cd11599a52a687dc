Nigeria’s Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) has commenced investigation into the accident involving an airline operated by Dana Airline. AIB under the Federal Ministry of Transportation is set up to investigate any civil aircraft accident and serious incident in Nigerian airspace. It is aimed at improving aviation safety by determining the circumstances and causes of air accidents in Nigeria.  The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has also heightened safety oversight over the operator after the accident. The investigation by AIB is in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 13. ‎  Mr. James Odaudu, Spokesperson of the Minister of State for Aviation, said efforts are in place to continuously enhance safety and security in the aviation sector. “Efforts are in place to continuously enhance Safety and Security in our industry in accordance with the reformation agenda of the Buhari Administration for the aviation sector,” he said.  The ministry sympathised with the passengers on the aircraft over the traumatic experience and assures that the government would not falter in its commitment to the safety and security of lives and property in the Nigerian airspace.  The plane was on Tuesday involved in an accident. It overshot the runway in Port Harcourt Airport while flying from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in the nation’s capital Abuja. The Airport was closed briefly for safety reasons. It was reopened after proper assessment on Wednesday.
