Seven persons have been confirmed killed while 15 others sustained severe injuries in a fresh violence that has erupted in Kaduna state. Confirming the incident, the spokesman for the State Police Command, Mr. Aliyu Mukhtar, said several houses were destroyed during the crisis.  The violence which erupted in Kasuwa Magani village in Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State, was as a result of "some girls who wanted to change their religion but were scolded by some youth in the community,” a youth in the community told newsmen. Several shops were equally burnt as a result of the violence.  Trouble started in the community when two youths’ groups clashed over an alleged attempt to convert some girls from one religion to another. A youth leader in the area, Yahaya, also known as Dan Najeriya, who earlier spoke to Premium Times said, he saw at least three dead bodies during the clash. “I can confirmed to you that shops and houses have been set ablaze by a group of youth in the area. Many people have been injured and we also feared some even lost their lives because I saw three dead bodies with my eyes,” Dan Najeriya said.  Meanwhile, the Kaduna state Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has directed the security agencies to arrest the situation and restore peace in the area. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Samuel Aruwan, Governor El-Rufai also directed the security agencies to investigate the cause of the crisis, arrest all parties involved and bring them to book. Governor El-Rufai also ordered the State Emergency Management Agency to take inventory of damages and provide relief materials with immediate effect.
