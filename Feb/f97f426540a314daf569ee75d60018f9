Tributes have been pouring in for Bollywood superstar actress Sridevi Kapoor, who has died aged 54. The actress, known simply as Sridevi, died of a heart attack on Saturday while at a family wedding in Dubai.  Her husband and daughter, Khushi, were with her when she passed away on Saturday, reports say. Her brother-in-law, Sanjay Kapoor, said it had happened at about 23:00 local time (19:00 GMT), according to news site The Indian Express. He did not provide any further details.  Top Bollywood figures, sporting giants and leading politicians reacted with shock, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was "saddened" by her death. Over five decades, she featured in almost 300 films, including classics Mr India, Chandni, ChaalBaaz and Sadma. She was considered one of the very few Indian female superstars capable of huge box office success without the support of a male hero. Crowds gathered outside Sridevi's home in Mumbai as news emerged.  A spokesperson for Sridevi's husband, who is the producer Boney Kapoor, told the Indian news agency Asian News International that her body would be flown from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday.  In 2013, the Indian government awarded her the Padma Shri - the fourth highest civilian honour.  The actress was in the United Arab Emirates to attend the wedding of her nephew, Mohit Marwah.
