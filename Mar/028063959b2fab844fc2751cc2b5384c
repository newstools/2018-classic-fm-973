President Muhammadu Buhari has assured that he will be relentless in his effort to ensure the release of the abducted Dapchi girl, Leah Sharibu who was not released by the Boko Haram Islamic sect because she is a Christian and refused to convert to Islam. 104 out of the 110 abducted girls from Dapchi Government Science and Technical School, Yobe State were on Wednesday morning released by their abductors, five were said to have died while little Miss Sharibu was said to have been held back because she rebuffed attempt to be converted to Islam.  President Buhari in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu Thursday in Abuja said he was as committed to the freedom of the only Dapchi schoolgirl still in captivity as he was to the girls’ freedom when all 110 were in the captivity of Boko Haram terrorists. He said, “The Buhari administration will not relent in efforts to bring Leah Sharibu safely back home to her parents as it has done for the other girls after she was held back by the terrorists over her decision, as reported, not to convert from Christianity to Islam.  “President Buhari is fully conscious of his duty under the constitution to protect all Nigerians, irrespective of faith, ethnic background or geopolitical location and will not shirk in this responsibility. The President is equally mindful of the fact that true followers of Islam all over the world respect the injunction that there is no compulsion in religion. To this effect, no one or group can its religion on another.” He further stated that “His heart goes out to the isolated parents who must watch others rejoice while their own daughter is still away. “The lone Dapchi Girl, Leah, will not be abandoned. “President Buhari assures the Sharibu family that he will continue to do all he can to ensure that they also have cause to rejoice with their daughter soon.”
