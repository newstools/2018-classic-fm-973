There was no envelope mix-up, Hollywood's biggest night concluded without a hitch at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, in an evening that celebrated diversity. Amid salutes to equality movement Time's Up and the box office contributions of women and minorities, the 90th annual Academy Awards ran as expected. Guillermo del Toro's fantastical romance The Shape of Water nabbed the Best Picture statuette in addition to Best Director. The curious story of a mute janitor who falls in love with an aquatic creature tallied four wins in total, more than any other movie.  "We will always remember this year as the year men screwed up so badly, women started dating fish," joked host Jimmy Kimmel during his opening monologue, in a nod to the #MeToo movement and subsequent sexual harassment reckoning. The Time's Up movement was acknowledged further in a segment by Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek and Annabella Sciorra, who were among the scores of women who accused producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. (He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.) The performing categories played out entirely as expected, with awards going to odds-on favorites. Frances McDormand won Best Actress for revenge drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri; Best Actor went to Gary Oldman in Winston Churchill biopic Darkest Hour. Sam Rockwell scored Best Supporting Actor, also for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and Alison Janney nabbed Best Supporting Actress for Tonya Harding biopic I, Tonya.  McDormand provided perhaps the most impactful moment of the night, using her acceptance speech to invite all female nominees in the audience to stand up. "Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed," she said. "Invite us into your office in a couple days, or you can come to ours, whatever suits you best, and we'll tell you all about them." McDormand, 60, also advocated for use of a so-called inclusion rider by performers during negotiation that would demand at least 50% diversity in casting and film crews. Those hoping for a Get Out sweep were sorely disappointed. The comedic horror scored only one award, for Best Original Screenplay. In doing so, Jordan Peele became the first African-American writer ever to win an Academy Award. He wrote and directed the hit, which grossed $255 million on a $4.5 million budget. "Everybody who bought a ticket, who told somebody to buy a ticket, thank you," said Peele, during his acceptance speech. It was his first Oscar nomination.
