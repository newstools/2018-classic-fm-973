The Federal Government has eliminated 30,000 ghost officers from Nigeria Police payroll via Integrated Personnel Payroll System, IPPIS, platform. Presidency sources revealed that the police payroll had the names of about 370, 000 officers, as well as rank and file. However, two weeks ago, when the police was brought on the Integrated Personnel Payroll System, IPPIS, platform, that number reduced to 291,685.  The replaced payment system was described as “very inefficient and corrupt” but that with it having been brought on the IPPIS platform, those feeding fat from it through corrupt means would no longer be able to manipulate it. It was learned that there had been subtle resistance by some corrupt officers who were benefiting from the old system as they tried to stop the police from being brought on IPPIS.  With the new development, it was learned that some arbitrary deductions, which police officers used to be subjected to, had come to an end as each of them would now be credited directly from the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation. Sources said although opposition to the IPPIs has continued, President Muhammadu Buhari was determined to implement the policy to its logical conclusion by bringing every Federal Government staff on the platform.
