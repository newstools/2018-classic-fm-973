The Director General of National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking In Person (NAPTIP), Dame Julie Okah-Donli has revealed that there is a new dimension of mass recruitment AND trafficking of Nigerians to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Dubai and Qatar under the guise of gainful employment.  She revealed this during an interactive session with Broadcast Editors in Abuja, disclosing that Nigerians should be re-oriented to be aware of the sexual exploitations, organ harvesting, domestic abuse these persons are facing in the destination countries in search of greener pastures.  The DG however lamented the inadequate resources and support from Federal, State government and private individuals to adequately tackle the issue of human trafficking and remove Nigeria from the Tier 2 Watch list downgrade by United Nations. She charged the media and Nigeria citizens to support the fight against human trafficking to make it a national priority.  Our Correspondent Raliat Adenekan reports that according to the UN Trafficking in Person’s report, Nigeria was further downgraded to Tier 2 Watch list, owing to the use of Child soldiers in the North east, not meeting up with the minimum standard for the elimination of human trafficking.
