The former Governor of Anambra State, Mr.  Peter Obi has called on Federal, State and Local Governments to stop all forms of taxations and levies on voluntary agencies and privately-owned primary and secondary schools across the country that render services  for the common good. Mr Obi made this call during his visit to Christ The King College(CKC) Ijebu Ode,  which is the best School in West African Examination Council (W.A.E.C) in 2017. Obi who noted that education was a foundation and most critical  comportment of development in any society, called on government at all levels to pursue progress and development anchored on education since, according to him, the level of growth among nations are directly proportional to their  investment in education. He said that one of the major problems facing Nigeria was the low level of educational penetration in some of her states.  Making a case for free basic education, Obi said that “Since Nigeria is signatory to free Universal Basic Education, and claims that education at basic level is free, it should give support to all institutions providing basic education irrespective of ownership as is  obtainable in other nations today. Since no level of Government gives any form of support to these schools  in the form of  finances or provision of educational equipment, the least they can do is to stop  bothering them with all manner of taxes and levies.”  Mr Obi further thanked voluntary agencies and private primary and school owners for their contributions to basic education in Nigeria and  urged them to continue to improve the quality of their teachings and facilities. While thanking the Proprietor, Manager, Principal, teachers and students of CKC Ijebu Ode, he called on other owners of schools to emulate them by supporting their schools through the provision of  first class facilities. The highpoint of the visit was the presentation of a cheque of 1 Million Naira to the School for continued improvement of their facilities.
