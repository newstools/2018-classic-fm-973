Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has disclosed that one of his major regrets he had in life was the early demise of his parents, who he said did not live to reap the fruits of their labour. This was as the All Progressives Congress, APC, hailed the former President on the occasion of his 81st birthday, describing him as a bastion of democracy in Africa.  Obasanjo, who clocked 81 Monday, said he wished his parents were alive to witness his growth and success in life and to appreciate the sacrifice they made while raising him. The former President said this at his 81 birthday celebration  held at Marque Events Centre of  the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta . He, however, expressed optimism that his late parents would still be happy in their graves till date.  His words: “One thing I always miss and remember is that my parents left this world too early. The sacrifice they made, they did not wait to see the results. How I wish they have waited to see and eat fruits of their labour. "But going by what Yoruba believe and say that, the dead always watch over their beloved ones and see happenings around them, I am convinced that, my parents are happy in their graves, as they watch over me. For me, this day, I have nothing but to continue to thank God, appreciate Him, praise Him and worship Him and adore Him for all that he has done for me personally, for members of my family, for my extended family, friends, peers and for those who have worked with me.”
