WBO world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker says he is ready to "go to war" with Anthony Joshua in Saturday's unification bout in Cardiff. Parker, 26, speaking at Wednesday's public workout at St David's Hall, said his team have got "under the skin" of WBA, IBF and IBO title holder Joshua. "He looks a little angry and tense. I'm young, hungry, fit and strong. I've got my speed back and I'll show you on Saturday," said Parker, as 400 fans watched on.  Briton Joshua, 28, stated he would maintain a "challenger's mindset" as he looks to defend his perfect 20 knockouts from 20 fights. He looked leaner as expected after weighing a career-high 18st 2lbs last time out and Parker, who is unbeaten in 24 fights, looked light on his feet and at ease in what will be the fighters' last public outing until Friday's weigh-in.  The New Zealand fighter was warmly received initially but drew boos when he pointed to the historic success his country's rugby team have had in Wales, stating: "I'm looking forward to keeping that record clean." And moments before Joshua appeared for his own workout, Parker delivered a message: "I'll see you Saturday, let's go to war".
