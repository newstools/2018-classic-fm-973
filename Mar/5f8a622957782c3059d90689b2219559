Son of Leonard Nimoy has wed Star Trek actress Terry Farrell on what would've been his dad's 87th birthday. The son of the actor famous for playing Mr Spock also had a role in Star Trek, as he directed episodes of The Next Generation. Farrell, who starred in the Deep Space Nine series of the science-fiction saga, announced her engagement to Adam Nimoy last year. The pair first went public as a couple at a Star Trek convention last year.  The couple, who married at San Francisco's City Hall, shared their wedding selfie with film critic Scott Mantz, who posted it on Twitter. Farrell, 54, and Nimoy, 61, received congratulations from stars of the Star Trek franchise, including Jeri Ryan, who played the Borg Seven of Nine on Star Trek: Voyager.  They were also called a "radiant couple" by Robert Picardo, known for his role as The Doctor on Star Trek: Voyager.  Leonard Nimoy, who was last seen as Spock in 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness, died in February 2015 at the age of 83. A few months before he died, Leonard worked with Adam on a documentary called For the Love of Spock.
