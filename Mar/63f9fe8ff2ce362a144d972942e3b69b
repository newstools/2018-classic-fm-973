 Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba "can't be happy" being out of favour at Old Trafford, says France coach Didier Deschamps. Pogba, 25, is in the France squad for friendlies with Colombia and Russia, after being an unused substitute for United against Brighton on Saturday. "I'm sure I'll hear more about it. But of course it's a situation he won't be enjoying," said Deschamps.  United return to Premier League action against Swansea, 31 March. Pogba started United's Champions League defeat against Sevilla last Tuesday, having missed the win over Liverpool because of injury. "I don't know why that is. As to why or how things came to this, there may be many reasons. I have a great deal of talks with players at our training camps, to gauge their feelings. It's not just Paul," added Deschamps.  Pogba rejoined United in 2016 for a fee of £89m and helped them win the League Cup and Europa League last season.
