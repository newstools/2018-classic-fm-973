The Senate Tuesday rejected a Bill for an act to amend the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Act, seeking to allow the option of wearing skirts by female corps members. The bill sponsored by Sen. Emmanuel Bwacha representing Taraba state seeks to provide option for female corps members to wear skirts rather than the mandatory trousers.  Our Correspondent, raliat Adenekan reports that this was however rejected as other lawmakers in their contribution opined that there are other more important issues to overhaul the scheme rather than concentrating on the issues of dressing. Briefing newsmen after plenary, Sen. Bwacha explained that the bill which was misunderstood by his colleagues has no religious leanings and is very relevant to Corps members that are made to wear trousers out of their will.  Meanwhile, the Senate has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to retract his decision in withholding assent on the bill to establish Peace Corps of Nigeria. This followed the adoption of a Point of Order raised by Sen. Dino Melaye during plenary, relying on Order 43 of the Senate rules. Sen. Melaye urged the Senate to revisit the bill with a view to veto the president if he failed to rescind his rejection of the bill adding that the bill should be given priority by Mr President. Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that it would be recalled that President Buhari cited duplication of duty and funding challenges in declining assent to the Nigerian Peace Corps (Establishment) Bill, 2017 recently passed by the National Assembly.
