Residents of Peace Estate in Baruwa area of Ipaja, were thrown into panic Thursday, following the explosion of a Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC’s pipeline, which resulted in fire. But for the swift response of the men of the Lagos State Fire Service and other rescue operators, the fire would have spread to buildings close by.  There were different versions as to how the explosion occurred. A version had it that there had been a leakage in one of the pipelines, which spilled petroleum products into farmlands. When farmers set the bush on fire in preparation for the new planting season, the explosion occurred.  Another version had it that some persons were scooping the spilled product when one of them threw a stick of cigarette away. When the state’s Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, arrived the scene, he said: “I can see constructions close to the pipeline’s right of way. Perhaps people carry out these constructions without knowledge of the implication.”
