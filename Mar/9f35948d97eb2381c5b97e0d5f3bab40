TV presenter Ant McPartlin has been arrested on suspicion of drunk-driving after a collision involving three vehicles in south-west London. The Metropolitan Police said officers were called to Lower Richmond Road in Mortlake at 15:59 GMT on Sunday. The ambulance service and London Fire Brigade were available to attend to a number of people who were treated for minor injuries.  Police said a 42-year-old man was arrested at the scene after failing a roadside breathalyser test. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning before being released under investigation on Monday. A child passenger in one of the cars was taken to hospital for a check-up as a precaution, the Met added. Mr McPartlin, who co-hosts several ITV shows with Declan Donnelly, including I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, confirmed in January he was divorcing his wife of 11 years, Lisa Armstrong.  The Bafta-winning star spent two months in rehab last year after admitting his painkiller and alcohol addiction. The addiction stemmed from a painful knee operation in 2015. Mr McPartlin said he was clean from drugs and alcohol in August and returned to presenting duties in November on I'm A Celebrity. He and Mr Donnelly have established themselves as one of Britain's most popular TV double acts over the course of their careers and, for the 17th consecutive year, were voted by viewers as TV's best entertainment presenters at the National Television Awards in January.  Saturday Night Takeaway is broadcast live, Mr McPartlin is scheduled to be back on air this Saturday. ITV are yet to comment on whether Sunday's events will affect the show.
