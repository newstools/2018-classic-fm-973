The Senate has urged Governments and communities across the country to adopt strong measures to stem the tide of young persons still undertaking dangerous and illegal journeys out of the country.  It also called for adequate protection for Nigerians in distress in foreign countries and for them to be assisted to return home with their safety, security and rights guaranteed by the Nigerian government and host governments until their status are clarified or returned home. These are part of the recommendations of a two-day Senate Roundtable on Irregular Migration and Human Trafficking, held in Benin City, Edo State, aimed at identifying with communities and allowing grassroots access to an important discussion and profferingÂ  solutions. The Senate further called on the global community to improve its responses to the issues of irregular migration and human trafficking.
