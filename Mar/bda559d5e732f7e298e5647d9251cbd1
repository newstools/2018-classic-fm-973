The preliminary results released by 16 companies quoted on the NSE showed that their gross earnings went up by 30.4 percent to N2.477 trillion in 2017 from N1.899 trillion in 2016, a reflection of the trend in economic recovery. In the same vein, the 16 companies’ Profit Before Tax, PBT, rose by 46.1 percent to N594.9 billion in 2017 from N407.1 billion in 2016.  The stakeholders have opined that the Central Bank o f Nigeria's, (CBN) recent policy on management of Non Performing Loans, NPLs, may moderate earning of some banks. They further said that though the results released so far are in line with expectations, they have not enjoyed commensurate reaction from the investing public. The apex bank had stated that banks that do not meet the minimum capital adequacy ratio shall not be allowed to pay dividend. Also banks that have a Composite Risk Rating (CRR) of “High” or a NPL ratio of above 10 percent shall not be allowed to pay dividend and banks that meet the minimum capital adequacy ratio but have a CRR of “Above Average” or an NPL ratio of more than five percent but less than 10 percent shall have dividend payout ratio of not more than 30 percent. Because the banking sector has largely dominated the stock market investment landscape, the stakeholders hold the opinion that whatever happens to the sector will have significant impact on the overall market positions.  A review of the 16 companies’ performance showed that the three banks that have turned in their results accounted for a whopping 55 percent of the total turnover recorded in 2017. The banks are: Zenith Bank that recorded N745.189 billion turnover, Guaranty Trust Bank, which posted N419.226 billion turnover, and Stanbic IBTC Plc with N212.343 billion. Four highly capitalised companies across the sectors, such as Nestle Nigeria Plc (N244.151 billion), Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc (N138 billion), Total Nigeria Plc (N288.062 billion) and Nigeria Breweries Plc (N344.563 billion), accounted for 40.9 percent of the total turnover, while nine other companies, which comprise Academy Press Plc (N2.117 billion), Grief Plc (N1.405 billion), Neimeth Pharmaceuticals (N1.534 billion), Vitafoam (N17.696 billion), Austin Laz & Co (N0.313 billion), Medview Airlines( N36.961 billion), United Capital (N8.915 billion), African Prudential (N3.004 billion) and Transcorp Hotel (N13.843 billion) accounted for a paltry 3.5 percent of the total turnover.  In terms of profitability, the three banks crowded out the others accounting for 78.1 percent of the 16 companies’ total PBT recorded in 2017; the four highly capitalised companies accounted for 19.9 percent of the total PBT, while the other companies accounted for an insignificant portion of two percent of the total PBT.
