President Muhammadu Buhari has written to both chambers of the National Assembly to withhold his assent to the controversial Electoral Act 2010 Amendment act which seeks to re-order the sequence of the general elections.  According to President Buhari in the letter read by Senate President, Bukola Saraki at plenary, the new amendment to the sequence of elections in Section 25 of the principal act, may infringe upon the constitutionally guaranteed discretion of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to organize, undertake and supervise elections provided in Section 15(A) of the third statue to the Constitution amongst other reasons.  He also told the lawmakers that the amendment to Section 138 of the principal act to delete two crucial grounds upon which an election may be challenged by candidates, unduly limits the rights of candidates in elections to a free and fair electoral review process  President Buhari also frowned at the amendment to Section 152 Subsection 325 of the Principal Act which he said may raise Constitutional issues over the competence of the National Assembly to legislate on local government elections.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the National Assembly had passed an amendment to the Electoral Act altering the election order as set out by INEC, raising concerns of a clandestine plot targeted at president Muhammadu Buhari.
