The Senate has summoned all the Service Chiefs over proliferation of Firearms in the country. This followed a motion moved by Sen.  Suleiman Hunkuyi (APC-Kaduna) who expressed grave concerns over the heavy influx of dangerous weapons into the country which he noted is partly responsible for the increase in kidnappings, communal, religious, farmers/herdsmen crises and killings across the country.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the upper chamber also mandated its Committee on Intelligence and National Security to conduct a thorough investigation with a view to unravel the remote and immediate causes of the act.  Also contributing respectively, Senate Leader, Sen. Ahmed Lawan (Yobe state) and Sen. Shehu Sani (Kaduna state) opined that the rate at which people were killed in the country was evident that there were more firearms than there were tractors and security agents to control it.  Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has written the Senate, requesting for the screening and subsequent confirmation of Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Festus Keyamo and 6 other members of the board of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance (NDIC). This was contained in executive communication  that was read by President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki at plenary in which President Buhari sought legislative approval for the appointments.  In a similar development, President Buhari has forward to the Senate the name of Attahiru Garba, for confirmation as a replacement for Resident Electoral Commissioner from Niger State.
