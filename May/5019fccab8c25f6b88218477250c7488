Federal Lawmaker representing Kaduna Central, Senator Shehu Sani has urged the senate to lift its embargo on screening and confirmation of the Board of Central Bank of Nigerian (CBN) forwarded to it since last year by President Muhammadu Buhari.  Citing order 43 of the Senate ‎during plenary, Sen Shehu appealed to the conscience of the Senate on the issue of creating a CBN board, stating that the unavailability of the board is limiting the capacities and functions of CBN.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the upper chamber had on March confirmed the nominees for the positions of Deputy Governor of the CBN and members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) while omitting the Board members and other pending confirmations.  In his remarks, Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki ruled that the Senate will look into the matter.  ‎It will be recalled that the Senate had placed an embargo on confirmation of Presidential nominees in line with its resolution in April in protest against the declaration by then Acting President Yemi Osinbajo, who was reported as saying that confirmation of nominees by the Senate was subject to Section 171 of the Constitution.
