In commemorating this year’s 2018 World Communication Day, His Eminence, Catholic Archbishop of Abuja John Onaiyekan has urged the presidency to report the truth to Nigerians at all times as a means to ensure transparency and credibility. While speaking at a Public lecture in Abuja with the theme “Journalism for Peace”, Onaiyekan noted that it was not enough for government to speak the truth but must equally showcase the truth through their actions. Onaiyekan, who equally tasked Nigerian journalists on the need to reduce reportage of sensational stories, added that the country was already in a sensitive position which must be handled with caution.  In his presentation, Special Adviser to the President On Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who was represented by Sir Atta Esa stated that the theme was apt as government was doing well to address the issues of insecurity in the country. According to Esa, who noted that Nigerian media had an enormous role to play in shaping the society implored media practitioners to maintain constrains and watch out against promotion of inciting statements particularly as the nation gears up towards the national elections.  Our correspondent, Ere-ebi Agedah reports that he also called on journalist to be credible in their dealings during the 2019 election as it will be a test of their integrity, as he enjoined media practitioners to avoid being used by politicians.
